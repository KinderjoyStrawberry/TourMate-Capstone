# TourMate Apps

TourMate : TourMate GitHub Repositories of Bangkit Academy 2022 Capstone Project from 3 learning path. Machine Learning, Mobile development, Cloud Computing from team C22-PS284.

# About The Project

Before traveling, usually we will make a plan in advance about the location to be visited and the time of departure. This is done to avoid problems, one of which is the distance to be traveled is farther until the time needed does not match expectations. To overcome this, our team uses the Traveling Salesman Problem method. We present TourMate as an application that is able to recommend several tourist attractions according to the location you want to go and provide the fastest and cheapest routes in visiting these places..
